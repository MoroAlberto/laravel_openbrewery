# Dockerized stack for Laravel 11 + MySQL

Based on: https://github.com/ucrem/docker-laravel-angular public template

A just installed **backend** container with:
* Laravel 11 
* PHP 8.3
* OPTIONAL: Zscaler certificate

A **mysql** container with official mysql: latest dockerhub image

A **phpmyadmin** container with the official dockerhub image phpmyadmin / phpmyadmin, linked to the mysql container in order to access the DB

A **nginx** webserver container with the official image of the dockerhub nginx: alpine

## Init Docker

The /docker/backend/supervisor/supervisord.conf file is linked in the backend container. Editing that file is instantly replicated to the container

### First Installation

To begin the installation, follow these steps:

Copy the `.env.example` file to create your own environment configuration file. This file will be used to set up the project and the database user for MySQL:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

#### Zscaler:

If you are using Zscaler, you need to install the Zscaler root certificate in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Zscaler intercepts SSL connections, terminating them at its end and creating a new SSL connection to the destination using its own certificate. To enable WSL to connect with this relayed connection, you must install a copy of the Zscaler root certificate.

1. Export a copy of the certificate from the Windows certificate store:
2. Open `certmgr.msc`.
3. In the left-hand panel, click on "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".
4. In the right-hand panel, scroll down to the entry "Zscaler Root CA".
5. Right-click on it and select "All Tasks -> Export...".
6. Choose "Base-64 encoded X.509 (.cer)".
7. Rename the exported file from `.cer` to `.crt`.
8. Place the `cacert.crt` file into the `/docker/backend` folder.
9. Uncomment the relevant lines in `/docker/backend/php.ini`.
10. Uncomment the relevant lines in `docker-compose.yml`.

Next, build the Docker containers:

```sh
docker-compose build
```

Wait for the configuration process to complete. Then start the containers:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Once all the containers are initialized, connect to the backend container:

```sh
docker exec -it PROJECT_NAME_backend /bin/bash
```

If you did not change the project name, use:

```sh
docker exec -it local_backend /bin/bash
```

You will be in the `/var/www/backend` directory.

Proceed by copying the `.env.example` file again and updating it with the same MySQL database name, user, and password as in the Docker instance:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, install all dependencies:

```sh
composer install
```

Generate the application key and run the database migrations with seed:

```sh
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate --seed
```

So here are the links currently configured:

backend: `localhost:8000`

phpmyadmin: `localhost:7000`


## Steps to Delete a Docker Build

### 1. List Docker Images

First, list all Docker images to identify the build you want to delete. Use the following command:

```sh
docker images
```

This command will display a list of all images with their corresponding image IDs, repository names, tags, and sizes.

### 2. Identify the Docker Image

From the list of images, identify the image you want to delete. Note down the `IMAGE ID` or `REPOSITORY:TAG` of the target image.

### 3. Delete the Docker Image

To delete a specific Docker image, use the following command:

```sh
docker rmi <IMAGE ID or REPOSITORY:TAG>
```
or

```sh
docker rmi myapp:latest
```

### 4. Force Delete (if necessary)

If the image is being used by a stopped container, you may encounter an error. To force delete the image, use the `-f` flag:

```sh
docker rmi -f <IMAGE ID or REPOSITORY:TAG>
```

### 5. List Docker Containers

Sometimes, you may also want to remove containers associated with a build. First, list all containers:

```sh
docker ps -a
```

This command will display a list of all containers, including stopped ones, with their corresponding container IDs and names.

### 6. Delete Docker Containers

To delete a specific Docker container, use the following command:

```sh
docker rm <CONTAINER ID or NAME>
```

Replace `<CONTAINER ID or NAME>` with the appropriate value. For example:

```sh
docker rm 1a2b3c4d5e6f
```

or

```sh
docker rm mycontainer
```

### 7. Clean Up Unused Resources

To clean up all unused images, containers, volumes, and networks, you can use the `docker system prune` command. This is useful to free up disk space:

```sh
docker system prune -a
```

You will be prompted to confirm the action. Type `y` and press Enter.

### Additional Tips

- **Check Disk Usage:** To see how much disk space Docker is using, you can use the following command:

  ```sh
  docker system df
  ```

- **Remove Dangling Images:** Dangling images are layers that are not tagged and are not referenced by any container. To remove them, use:

  ```sh
  docker image prune
  ```
